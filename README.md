# 📉 Gradient Descent from Scratch – Machine Learning Series

Welcome to my implementation of **Gradient Descent**, one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning. This project is part of my learning journey in the series **#LearnMLwithArjun**, where I implement machine learning algorithms from the ground up to understand the core concepts deeply.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

This repository includes:

1. **Gradient Descent on a Simple Dataset**  
   - A basic dataset (e.g., `x = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `y = [5,7,9,11,13]`)
   - Learn how the algorithm iteratively finds the best fit line
   - Visual demonstration of cost reduction over iterations

2. **Gradient Descent on Real-World Data**  
   - Dataset: `test_scores.csv` (Math vs. CS test scores)
   - Converted to NumPy arrays for fast computation
   - Calculated the slope (`m`) and intercept (`b`) using manual gradient updates
   - Observed how the model learns from data through iteration
